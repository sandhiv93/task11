The Difference Between Exception and Error
Exception: 
1.	Exceptions are occurred in unexpected situations that occur during the execution of a program. 
2.	These Situation can be caused by external factors, such as User Input or Internal factors, such as coding errors. 
3.	When an Exception occurs, the Program is interrupted and an error message is displayed. 
4.	The purpose of Exceptions is to provide a way for the program to gracefully handle unexpected events and prevent the program from crashing.
5.	Example like “Null Pointer Exception”, “File Not Found Exception” etc…,

Error
1.	An error, is a mistake or problem in the code that prevents the program from Executing as intended. 
2.	Errors are typically caused by Syntax Errors or logical errors in the code. Unlike Exceptions, Errors are not meant to be handled by the program. 
3.	Instead, the programmer must identify and fix the error in the code in order for the program to run correctly.
4.	Syntax Errors such as missing of semicolon(;), misspelling of keywords and identifiers etc…
5.	Example Like “out Of Memory Error”, “Stack Overflow Error” etc..,
